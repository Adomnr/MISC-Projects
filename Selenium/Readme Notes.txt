1) Click on extract_data_fast.exe

2) Click and Enter your desired team1 against team2.

3) Wait for the button to reset to its position.

4) Your data will be extracted in the file "data.xlsx".

Note: You need to close data.xlsx file if you want to enter new data. You do not need to close the GUI.

The Console will launch with it. It is there in case you face any problem with it. If you use it and there is no problem.
I will send you another file to replace that file and it will not have any console with it.

Thank you!
